        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>LotLuck is being developed to provide a platform for people to share their experiences renting cars.</p>
        <p>I find that traditional reviewing platforms don't give enough information about what to expect from a specific car rental location. This tool hopes to provide that.</p>
